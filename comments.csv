Very interesting and inspiring post. 

Do you mind if I ask how young you are right now?

I'm turning 40 this year, and I've been a Data Analyst for years. 6 digits na rin naman at WFH, pero hirap makausad, at time intensive din sa current company ko. 
I'm looking for a way to maximize my time and increase my income streams while I can, to save and invest for retirement.

The reason I'm asking is just to gauge if my age would still fit for this type of role.

My current role is handling Google Search ads for a year but more on troubleshooting and not on optimization. Marami akong nakikitang hiring for this role and already applied na rin but no luck. 

Curious lang ako if we have the same nature of work ba?

For Google ads, medyo mas matagal yung ramping up nila esp if bago pa lang and medyo complicated ang pag gamit din ng tools.

With Amazon PPC, do you think it‚Äôs less complicated than google ads search? Medyo wide kasi Google Ads imo but im curious about Amazon PPC. Saka sa job postings for Search Ads, the job descriptions are a lot. Do you think mas madaling gamitin ang Amazon compared to Google Ads?

1ivqbkd,"Good job OP! I‚Äôm a Meta ads manager and Google PPC manager for 2 separate marketing agencies, eto palang kaya so far, though andami nagrereach out weekly or minsan everyday sa OLJ lalo pag may expi na. All clients hired from OLJ din ako.

I can really relate to most of what you said OP! Especially when it comes to meetings. Lagi ko gamit na gamit yung ‚ÄúI have to go outside to buy meds‚Äù üòÇ I also have a 1-year old and a 5-year old kids, and i don‚Äôt even want to go there sa kung ano anong mga reasons nagagamit ko, alang alang to sa pera! üòÇ

I‚Äôm keeping an eye on Amazon PPC for quite a while now OP. I just want to know kung mas mahirap sya kesa sa Google ads, kase napakalawak din ng learning curve ni Google grabe. I don‚Äôt know, but I just have this obsession to learn and work on different ad platforms(Jack-of-all-trades basically) üòÇ

My journey started 8 months ago(no experience) nag-resign din sa corpo that I‚Äôve been with for 6 years. Started applying sa OLJ then nabigyan ng chance kahit walang experience sa Meta ads. After 3 months of being hired, a client from OLJ reached out if I want to be their Google PPC manager. Initially, the CEO wants me to leave the first client but the workload for Meta is very easy that it can be done in 1-2 hours. Also, the offer is the same for me for Google and Meta, so I said no but he still hired me(minsan need natin maging pranka).

Now, nasa stage na learning while earning ako and faked it til i make it din(not for everyone). I know parehas tayo ng pinaka important skill to learn, is to be resourceful. Kaya i don‚Äôt have to ask na siguro, just google/youtube/reddit/chatgpt everything. 
 
Thanks OP kase dahil sa post mo nabuhayan ako sa Amazon PPC as I never knew anything about amazon ppc opportunities at all before I saw your post.

I've never had work experience with anything involving data. For context, I've only ever worked in the creative field. Do you think someone who is naturally not into data will get the hang of PPC?

Also, you mentioned joining an agency first - does that mean one can land a job even without experience? A year ago, I almost landed a gig who needed someone to create A+ content but they got someone who had experience with it.

In my head I can't find even a crumb to offer from my experiences that I can connect to PPC if ever I could get an interview. Haha

I'm really curious how to start. I'm someone who learns more by doing. Do you know of any programs or apprenticeship for people who want to learn hands on?

1gxw6ge,"Sir PLDT User, quick question lang po. I recently purchased the Xiaomi WiFi Extender AC1200 and I had a problem with the extender kasi it keeps disconnecting for some time. I read somewhere that the extender loses its connection to the router when the router changes the network channel. So ang workaround daw is to set the network channel to a fixed channel instead of auto (for both 2.4 and 5G), which I did. And it worked!

  
The problem is, may mga times na bumabagal yung internet when I'm connected sa extender. I believe that's because the router network is only set to a fixed channel. Unlike sa default settings na naka auto (network channel optimization as I read somewhere). 

Will I have this same problem if I buy the TP-Link AC1200? Nawawala din ba connection ng TP-Link extender kapag naka-auto yung router network channel?",sir pldt user quick question lang po i recently purchased the xiaomi wifi extender ac1200 and i had a problem with the extender kasi it keeps disconnecting for some time i read somewhere that the extender loses its connection to the router when the router changes the network channel so ang workaround daw is to set the network channel to a fixed channel instead of auto for both 24 and 5g which i did and it worked the problem is may mga times na bumabagal yung internet when i'm connected sa extender i believe that's because the router network is only set to a fixed channel unlike sa default settings na naka auto network channel optimization as i read somewhere will i have this same problem if i buy the tplink ac1200 nawawala din ba connection ng tplink extender kapag nakaauto yung router network channel

14eoj5k,"Fellow voice actor here. To do this you have to be really active. I've lost so many opportunities due to my day job. And just like with any other job we've seen here, it can take months or even years before you see a little bit of success. Albeit, more often than not it's your fault.

Now for some more tips: Get a decent dynamic microphone (like a Samson Q2U), dynamic microphones are a lot less sensitive than condensers (like the BM800) meaning that a lot of the noise that Filipino voice talents commonly have problems with aren't picked up by the mic (pero mahirap talaga pag malapit ka sa highway). But if you can't afford it yet then just follow what OP said.

Practice, always practice reading long form articles and the like so that when you're given a 1000+ word script you won't fumble and end up with a recording what should be less than 10 minutes into something close to an hour. YouTube is a starting point for a lot of newbies, either for experience or to get a budget, so focus on developing skills here for now.

Have friends interact with you in the platforms you've chosen. Places like Fiverr favor sellers that respond quickly and frequently to buyers, meaning they'll boost us in their algorithm leading to more interactions and hopefully clients. Unlike actual casting calls (which I don't recommend yet if you haven't had the proper training and equipment) Fiverr doesn't care if you're talented or not. You'll have so many great sounding people on the platform barely getting anything but have someone that barely speaks English straight have hundreds of reviews. So to get the gears going so to say, have friends buy from you and leave 5 star reviews to get yourself out there. It feels dirty, but that's how a lot of people do it there nowadays.

Mind your accent. If you have a neutral, British, or American accent then you don't really have to practice it. If you're just getting there, then just train a bit more, a little while longer then you're there. But if you don't and you have a very noticeable Filipino accent, then don't practice having a different accent. Market yourself as you are, everyone is looking for something different, just practice reading straight and having emotion when needed and you'll get somewhere. There's somebody for everybody, and those words ring true in voice over.

There's a wealth of information out there, and I hope you'll use it well.

Goodluck to all of you and your journeys",fellow voice actor here to do this you have to be really active i've lost so many opportunities due to my day job and just like with any other job we've seen here it can take months or even years before you see a little bit of success albeit more often than not it's your fault now for some more tips get a decent dynamic microphone like a samson q2u dynamic microphones are a lot less sensitive than condensers like the bm800 meaning that a lot of the noise that filipino voice talents commonly have problems with aren't picked up by the mic pero mahirap talaga pag malapit ka sa highway but if you can't afford it yet then just follow what op said practice always practice reading long form articles and the like so that when you're given a 1000 word script you won't fumble and end up with a recording what should be less than 10 minutes into something close to an hour youtube is a starting point for a lot of newbies either for experience or to get a budget so focus on developing skills here for now have friends interact with you in the platforms you've chosen places like fiverr favor sellers that respond quickly and frequently to buyers meaning they'll boost us in their algorithm leading to more interactions and hopefully clients unlike actual casting calls which i don't recommend yet if you haven't had the proper training and equipment fiverr doesn't care if you're talented or not you'll have so many great sounding people on the platform barely getting anything but have someone that barely speaks english straight have hundreds of reviews so to get the gears going so to say have friends buy from you and leave 5 star reviews to get yourself out there it feels dirty but that's how a lot of people do it there nowadays mind your accent if you have a neutral british or american accent then you don't really have to practice it if you're just getting there then just train a bit more a little while longer then you're there but if you don't and you have a very noticeable filipino accent then don't practice having a different accent market yourself as you are everyone is looking for something different just practice reading straight and having emotion when needed and you'll get somewhere there's somebody for everybody and those words ring true in voice over there's a wealth of information out there and i hope you'll use it well goodluck to all of you and your journeys

Hope you don't mind if I ask some questions :)

* Do you do your own editing? what's your post processing like? Do you use other tools for clean up aside from Adobe Audition? How much time does it take you to edit, say, a 5-minute audio? I currently use Blue Yeti and it picks up A LOT of noise, but hoping to upgrade to a more professional mic. 

* Do you review the script beforehand or do you read it as is? Did you take training when you realized this gig can be lucrative?

* I'm curious how you progressed with your current rate. And can I ask how you made it to 60$ per hr? I do occassional commissions and I charge per word. Currently it's at 15-30$ per 1,000 words but I'm not sure if this is fair since I'll just start with Upwork.

Pronunciations matters but a simple google search will help you if there are some words you find difficult.

14eoj5k,"**Do you do your own editing?** \- Yes and no, details to follow below

**What's your post processing like?** \- While I would do most of the editing myself, due to the influx of clients I trained a Virtual Assistant to do clean up for my audio (cutting pauses and word flubs). But for post processing, if the clients wants it raw, I send it raw. But for the majority who wants a mastered audio, I use Parametic Equalizer to filter our unwanted frequencies. Then I bought RX9 from Izotope to help with Mouth Clicks. Tapos since I don't move my studio anymore, I save my this as one of my presets so one-click edit na lang ako everytime (then I might send it to my virtual assistant to cut out the fluff)

**Do you use other tools for clean up aside from Adobe Audition?** \- No\~

**How much time does it take you to edit, say, a 5-minute audio?**  \- I edit at 2x speed. 5 minute audio would take me around 3-4 minutes if not a lot of mistakes

**I currently use Blue Yeti and it picks up A LOT of noise, but hoping to upgrade to a more professional mic.** \- Oh my gosh I used the Blue Yeti at one point for voice. Yes it does pick up a lot of noise, I sold it. I think switching to any XLR mic will do wonders. Altho I do see other people swear by their Yeti, and some voice actors I know use the Yeti. 

**Do you review the script beforehand or do you read it as is?** \- If new client I will just skim, kasi you'll never know what dark propaganda one might have. Pero pag regular I read it as is na, and correct any grammatical errors along the way.

**Did you take training when you realized this gig can be lucrative?** \- I did take training for video game and animation, but not intentionally for YouTube narration.

**I'm curious how you progressed with your current rate. And can I ask how you made it to 60$ per hr? I do occassional commissions and I charge per word.

The $60/hr rate is directed sessions.",do you do your own editing  yes and no details to follow below what's your post processing like  while i would do most of the editing myself due to the influx of clients i trained a virtual assistant to do clean up for my audio cutting pauses and word flubs but for post processing if the clients wants it raw i send it raw but for the majority who wants a mastered audio i use parametic equalizer to filter our unwanted frequencies then i bought rx9 from izotope to help with mouth clicks tapos since i don't move my studio anymore i save my this as one of my presets so oneclick edit na lang ako everytime then i might send it to my virtual assistant to cut out the fluff do you use other tools for clean up aside from adobe audition  no how much time does it take you to edit say a 5minute audio  i edit at 2x speed 5 minute audio would take me around 34 minutes if not a lot of mistakes i currently use blue yeti and it picks up a lot of noise but hoping to upgrade to a more professional mic  oh my gosh i used the blue yeti at one point for voice yes it does pick up a lot of noise i sold it i think switching to any xlr mic will do wonders altho i do see other people swear by their yeti and some voice actors i know use the yeti do you review the script beforehand or do you read it as is  if new client i will just skim kasi you'll never know what dark propaganda one might have pero pag regular i read it as is na and correct any grammatical errors along the way did you take training when you realized this gig can be lucrative  i did take training for video game and animation but not intentionally for youtube narration i'm curious how you progressed with your current rate and can i ask how you made it to 60 per hr i do occassional commissions and i charge per word currently it's at 1530 per 1000 words but i'm not sure if this is fair since i'll just start with upwork  it really depends for youtube narration i charge the same as you but for any other form of media i charge them according to this rate guide with some discounts if they can't afford it the 60hr rate is directed sessions

   * Yes, by the third year I just took [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/record-voice-overs-like-a-pro-step-by-step-blueprint/).

I drink so much water in a day, about 10 bottles. I don't shout anymore. I do vocal warm ups that are used by singers, and I do mouth stretches.

Pareho tayo ng setup, naka AX3 din ako. Also bought from the same seller. I was able to get around 780mbps tops via LAN in here, via WiFi mga 600-650mbps usually nakukuha ko. Mesh mode works between this and the AX3 and if that doesn't work, pwede mo naman isetup as WiFi relay mode, its basically the same as mesh mode.

Yung LAN is working. Akala ko din nung una sira yung LAN pero working pala sya. Initially I tried a bunch of cables pati yung LAN cable na kasama, umiilaw naman pagsinaksak pero di pa din nadedetect. So what I did last was to connect it to my PC via LAN. First di muna sya madedetect. Punta ka sa control panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections. Disable mo yung ethernet and reenable it. It will work afterwards. See my screenshot below, detected na as PLDT home yung network after enabling. Once ko lang ginawa tapos ok na sya afterwards. Pwede din via LAN papuntang AX3 but ok na din yung wireless setup for now.

1ioe54p,"They did fully exercised their right to SIM lock it to ""SMART"" yet you fail to understand how vague this is. There was no warning that PLDT could push firmware updates that would further restrict SIM compatibility after purchase. Nowhere in their product listing, FAQs, or terms did they explicitly state that even Smart SIMs could be blocked later via remote updates.

This is a serious issue because:

1. It removes consumer choice after purchase. Customers bought the modem expecting to use any Smart SIM, but PLDT later changed this without them knowing.
2. It allows PLDT to impose future restrictions without accountability. If they can silently block SIMs now, what's stopping them from further restricting promos, speed, or block all access to their promos on different products later? iyak nalang if that happens?
3. It creates a dangerous precedent for anti-consumer behavior. If left unchallenged, this could encourage other ISPs and companies to sell products with hidden post-purchase limitations, making consumers permanent hostages to their services.",they did fully exercised their right to sim lock it to smart yet you fail to understand how vague this is there was no warning that pldt could push firmware updates that would further restrict sim compatibility after purchase nowhere in their product listing faqs or terms did they explicitly state that even smart sims could be blocked later via remote updates this is a serious issue because 1 it removes consumer choice after purchase customers bought the modem expecting to use any smart sim but pldt later changed this without them knowing 2 it allows pldt to impose future restrictions without accountability if they can silently block sims now what's stopping them from further restricting promos speed or block all access to their promos on different products later iyak nalang if that happens 3 it creates a dangerous precedent for anticonsumer behavior if left unchallenged this could encourage other isps and companies to sell products with hidden postpurchase limitations making consumers permanent hostages to their services

You can zoom in on the photos you take on the base models just fine and with the myriad of editing tools around make it as sharp as a dedicated zoom lens. 60hz you quickly get used to as well.,i would argue different the base models are 90 of a phone the pros are at a significantly smaller pricetag especially in the case of the 15 series the only tangible difference is the telephoto zooms in the pros and 120hz refresh rate you can zoom in on the photos you take on the base models just fine and with the myriad of editing tools around make it as sharp as a dedicated zoom lens 60hz you quickly get used to as well

1e0bi0m,"I know na major issue and/or concern un hefty pricetag ng iphone 15pro and up, Gets naman. But trust me, you won't regret it once the feature drops and most phones na nirecommend ng others dito hindi makaka receive ng update.

To be quite frank, I honestly think most of the features listed on that website is passable. Ok lang wala. But as an iphone user I have to warn you with one use case that is Apple's Achilles heel: **its Siri.**

Current Siri is just so bad right now, for my use case which is using it for Apple Carplay, I can't even use it hands free, and sometimes when asking for specific music, its just hit or miss, and its frustrating, as I came from Goole Assistant/Android Auto, which not only I can operate completely hands free inlcuding maps, doesn't make a mistake whether I speak in a low voice or sometimes just speak regularly without aiming for an American accent. Siri is just frustrating in comparison.

A lot of people here just recommend Apple dahil ""lakas makasosyal"" but they rarely use the features it offers to the maximum to be honest. Pang clout chase lang talaga ang silhouette, the Apple logo at at the back and the 3 lenses sa mga Pinoy majority (not everyone). Yan ang real talk dito.

Now, you may not care/have a usecase like me, but if you think this applies to you as well, consider my advice. USB-C is already a HUGE reason to pick the 15Pro and up versus older models on top of everything else quite fact. Bukod sa mahal yung lightning cable, hassle magdala ng dalawang cable parati when you travel at sa tabi ng bedside.",i know na major issue andor concern un hefty pricetag ng iphone 15pro and up gets naman but trust me you won't regret it once the feature drops and most phones na nirecommend ng others dito hindi makaka receive ng update to be quite frank i honestly think most of the features listed on that website is passable ok lang wala but as an iphone user i have to warn you with one use case that is apple's achilles heel its siri current siri is just so bad right now for my use case which is using it for apple carplay i can't even use it hands free and sometimes when asking for specific music its just hit or miss and its frustrating as i came from goole assistantandroid auto which not only i can operate completely hands free inlcuding maps doesn't make a mistake whether i speak in a low voice or sometimes just speak regularly without aiming for an american accent siri is just frustrating in comparison a lot of people here just recommend apple dahil lakas makasosyal but they rarely use the features it offers to the maximum to be honest pang clout chase lang talaga ang silhouette the apple logo at at the back and the 3 lenses sa mga pinoy majority not everyone yan ang real talk dito now you may not carehave a usecase like me but if you think this applies to you as well consider my advice usbc is already a huge reason to pick the 15pro and up versus older models on top of everything else quite fact bukod sa mahal yung lightning cable hassle magdala ng dalawang cable parati when you travel at sa tabi ng bedside

1. Siri is a literal POS. Literally. 8/10 it won't understand you. Android auto simply just understands you better, and I dont even have to try with the accent and all.

3. The Map has a overall bigger screen. More screen real estate. Maps in Apple Carplay is abit more cramped, even the combined view with the map and the music in 1 screen, Apples is just so bad in comparison.

1jlsuyh,"I came from an A54 to S25 base model. I had to get the A54 because i lost my S21 FE. First of all, the top of the line A series phones will always have my heart because it took very good care of me after losing a phone I really liked. The only reason why I upgraded to the S25 was because the preorder deal was too good. I got it for like 25k with the trade-in and I got a free watch. 

To compare the A54 to the S25, the first difference I noticed was the speed. It's much faster. Restarting the phone was fast,  flipping through apps was fast. With that said, I'll be honest, the S25 doesn't feel like a *huge* difference. There's definitely a difference but not a night and day difference. Maybe because it's Samsung to Samsung, or maybe it's similar to how one feels upgrading from a previous gen iPhone to the latest one. Or maybe because innovation has been plateauing. Idk. But to spend 3x more the price of an A54-A56 for the latest flagship with its current features & specs, mid tier phones are winning. 

The AI is pretty cool. Not sure when the A55 gets it but when it does along with One UI 7, it's going to be even more similar to the S25.

If you want to try something different and you're still going to keep the A55, you might want to consider the iPhone. Having the A55 and S25 would feel really similar, too similar, especially of you're looking for a different experience. My wife has the iPhone pro max and it's nice. Pics are great. Battery life is excellent. As a long time Samsung user since the Note 2 days, I'd say go for the iPhone. Resell value is high and it sells fast! When my wife upgrades and I put her phone up for sale, I can sell it the same day!

it still have folio and legal profile when installed and set default in the windows operating system.

madali lang ding tangalin yung ink waste just 2 screws sa gilid banda, marami ding free resetter online kaya recommended ko talaga yang L5290 and L3250.

yung L220 walang folio and legal profile you have to create it manually, mahirap din tangalin yung ink waste kasi nasa ilalim mismo.



if you ever got 1 of them, make sure na bawat reset empty the waste ink tank.  
  
don't throw the plastic cover nya sa box, use it to cover your printer pag hindi ginagamit, para hindi mapasukan ng alikabuhok at mga tao ng butiki sa likod, or mapasukan ng butiki, ipis at daga.

also only use ink sa mismong epson store sa orange app, para walang lines pag nag priprint kahit matagal nang naka store or hindi ginagamit. recommended to buy 2 black, 1 yellow blue red 003.

1. Buy a Deco mesh system. Over the years, I went from using Google Wifi, Deco M4, Deco M5, and now WiFi 6 Deco x55.
2. Run a short lan cable from your modem to the main Deco mesh and place it *somewhat* closer to your bedroom.
3. Connect your second mesh to your main mesh via WiFi (wirelessly).
4. Connect your computer to your second mesh (which is also located inside your bedroom) via a LAN cable (wired).

The connection on your computer will show up as a wired connection, even if technically your actual connection is wireless (at least in the middle, from the first deco to the second deco).

Modem <wired connection> First Deco <wireless connection> Second Deco <wired connection> Computer

Kumbaga parang ang nangyari, ginamit mo yung second mesh as a Wifi Adapter. LOL

I had to do the same exact thing before. I had a client that wanted to ""see"" that I had a wired connection, complete with me sharing my computer via screen share, opening up my computer settings and them seeing that I had an actual wired connection.

With that being said, the easiest and most cost-effective solution to your problem would be to just run a 10 to 15 meter LAN cable from your modem to your computer in the bedroom.

1. Get a mesh. Layout a cable into the mesh node and put it more on the center of the home. Then get another and put it in your work area then use a cable connect it to your workstation pc.

2. Dont change anything. That looks like a wifi 6 router its already a router that could cover your home unless its a 4 bedroom or a mansion. The only thing you need to observe in this is latency (ms) it should be less than 10 and your good to go. Your employer won't know if your connected to wifi or wired.

The Android app on your phone kinda sucks tho, looks outdated but works naman. Also you can get a Xiaomi weighing scale. Just step on it and it'll save the readings on your phone. It's a simple but effective ecosystem. The scale can also decipher 2 different people. Like if my wife steps on the scale it'll save her weight to her records and mine to mine. 

If I remember correctly you can do a workaround and sync your sleep, stress, workouts etc to Google Fit or Samsung health of you're using a Samsung, for a better UI. Also weight records from the scale.

I've since moved on to a galaxy watch a few yrs ago which actually broke recently when I wore it in the water sa beach (i know dumb move lol) and using a Huawei Fit 3 now. Between the fit 3 and mi band in terms of functionality  not much difference, except for the interface. Waiting on my galaxy phone where I'll get a free watch so I'll be going back to the Galaxy watch. But iba parin and long battery life of mi band and fi 3 vs galaxy watch or even apple watch.

1elc81q,"Pros:
- Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 for a good price. Some might say it's overclocked but the cooling handles quite well.
- Updates improve reliability 
- Case/accessories are easy to find in Lazada/Shopee.
- 20MP front camera is a big leap from the POCO X4 GT's 16MP and it has HDR.
- 50MP main camera is a modest upgrade from the POCO X4 GT's 64MP 
- Makunat battery (5000mah) with 90w wired charging speed
- IR Blaster
- IP64 protection
- Screen still usable even in wet conditions
-  Weight difference between the Redmi Turbo 3 and POCO X4 GT is night and day

Cons:
- China ROM only (no local warranty or Global ROM)
- You can't disable native Chinese assistant (Mi AI)
- 8MP Ultrawide Camera remains unchanged from the POCO X4 GT's. 
- Delayed notifications on other apps
- No 3.5mm headphone jack
- Fingerprint lock on the screen is a bit concerning, especially if you break it and get it replaced.

off the bat, some limitations i can think of are:
- ipad users typically buy note taking apps (ex. notability, goodnotes etc.)
- since note taking ay one of your main reason of buying, mga ipad na ganyang price range ay malamang sa malamang mababa sa storage. mangyayare nyan is either mag susubscribe ka sa icloud or mag babackup and delete ka ng madalas.

1jd0s0f,"Update regarding to this, got the PC last Monday evening, been exploring/testing it ever since for the past days. Though I don't wanna bore you with this PC, just the GPU instead obviously.

Disclaimer:

1. Seller is the one who installed the OS and important drivers na, with stress test and benchmark of each components. What I only did is tweak some aspects on the BIOS, installed other drivers, updated those said drivers and software, and basically turned off every Windows 11 option co-related to gaming. Like Game Bar, Game Mode, Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. I guess de-bloated myself too, basically uninstalled anything XBOX related.
2. All fans, fan controls, GPU fans, basically anything related to performance is set to default/normal. I also have no plans to Overclock.
3. Paired with the Ryzen 7 7700, not the 7700x. I purposely chose the non X model just because it runs cooler and is less power-hungry. Besides, in terms of performance the difference is very incremental lang. Using AIO cooler btw.
4. Monitor is 1440p, 144hz. No SYNC settings (whether AMD or NVIDIA)
5. NVIDIA Control Panel is HEAVILY modified. [This video as reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LMURlXc5-8&t=2s)

The most GPU-Intensive game I am currently running is Wuthering Waves, everything is basically on high settings with the exception of Ray-Tracing and Frame Generation. Using MSI Afterburner, I very rarely exceed 60 degrees C, at most the highest I ever saw was 63 degrees, that was in the ""Whimpering Waves"" end game mode. VSYNC on 120fps

Honkai Star Rail, GPU is too overkill. Never exceeds 50 degrees, I don't need to elaborate this further since you have experienced this game already. I have fake frames enabled (Nvidia DLSS) with VSYNC on 60fps sharp. If you wanna add me here's my UID: 800294115 (day 1 player, more bias with that game because I grew up with Honkai Impact 3rd)

No plans to test Cyberpunk 2077 or other GPU-intensive games, have to download it pa.  Though in the next Steam Sale. I have plans to buy all Final Fantasy VII remakes, and maybe Black Myth Wukong if its on sale

Adobe Premiere, works like I expected it too be. Didn't try 1440p editing yet, as of writing this. Very Heavy Excel? its more CPU and RAM intensive so no need to comment.

I reallyyy wanna buy 3DMark just to test this GPU, but I'm still contemplating if its justified since the seller showed me a stress test/benchmark video already.

Any current hindrances? Just with android emulators, but that's more on Microsoft's fault with Windows 11's implementation, My last setup was still using Windows 10 and I have no plans to upgrade that, even EOL hits.

**TL;DR: My GPU seems fine for my use case, but take this with a grain of salt since my PC is freshly built. The seller installed the OS, while I handled downloading and updating the necessary drivers, tweaking OS and BIOS settings, and making extensive modifications in the Nvidia Control Panel (reference video link above).**",update regarding to this got the pc last monday evening been exploringtesting it ever since for the past days though i don't wanna bore you with this pc just the gpu instead obviously disclaimer 1 seller is the one who installed the os and important drivers na with stress test and benchmark of each components what i only did is tweak some aspects on the bios installed other drivers updated those said drivers and software and basically turned off every windows 11 option corelated to gaming like game bar game mode hardwareaccelerated gpu scheduling i guess debloated myself too basically uninstalled anything xbox related 2 all fans fan controls gpu fans basically anything related to performance is set to defaultnormal i also have no plans to overclock 3 paired with the ryzen 7 7700 not the 7700x i purposely chose the non x model just because it runs cooler and is less powerhungry besides in terms of performance the difference is very incremental lang using aio cooler btw 4 monitor is 1440p 144hz no sync settings whether amd or nvidia 5 nvidia control panel is heavily modified this video as reference the most gpuintensive game i am currently running is wuthering waves everything is basically on high settings with the exception of raytracing and frame generation using msi afterburner i very rarely exceed 60 degrees c at most the highest i ever saw was 63 degrees that was in the whimpering waves end game mode vsync on 120fps honkai star rail gpu is too overkill never exceeds 50 degrees i don't need to elaborate this further since you have experienced this game already i have fake frames enabled nvidia dlss with vsync on 60fps sharp if you wanna add me here's my uid 800294115 day 1 player more bias with that game because i grew up with honkai impact 3rd no plans to test cyberpunk 2077 or other gpuintensive games have to download it pa though in the next steam sale i have plans to buy all final fantasy vii remakes and maybe black myth wukong if its on sale adobe premiere works like i expected it too be didn't try 1440p editing yet as of writing this very heavy excel its more cpu and ram intensive so no need to comment i reallyyy wanna buy 3dmark just to test this gpu but i'm still contemplating if its justified since the seller showed me a stress testbenchmark video already any current hindrances just with android emulators but that's more on microsoft's fault with windows 11's implementation my last setup was still using windows 10 and i have no plans to upgrade that even eol hits tldr my gpu seems fine for my use case but take this with a grain of salt since my pc is freshly built the seller installed the os while i handled downloading and updating the necessary drivers tweaking os and bios settings and making extensive modifications in the nvidia control panel reference video link above

1gaz5ud,"so if you want it to last longer physical wise as in build wise..buy the one which is the heaviest as in metal frame

if you have kids or you're sure they will eventually be handled by kids.. again but the heaviest/ most metal frame etc

this is if you're not planning on getting the case a nice case
as in heavy protective covering all sides and bumps and all

if you want it to be cheaper then the problem is usually the smoothness

software wise I dunno if the updates help in the long run as in if the battery wasn't big to begin with > 5000 mah the battery 
life will eventually drop by another 15 to 20 % by the first round of updates 

heating also is usually worse on the better chips and processors because the heat doesn't get dissapated properly if lots of apps and processing power required is intense 

I have a Lenovo from tab 10 the old snapdragon 450 one

software wise it's bullocks and survived only because it's built very well and my daughter uses it only for YouTube

but that's more than 10 years still the battery is not yet having depletion issues

I also have a new Nokia T20 from 2021? it has the unisoc chip from the time I bought it randomly had crashing issues on booting

it does lag if the space gets filled up..but otherwise because I put a solid heavy case. on it..it really holds up good

my daughter uses it for games.. especially Roblox..it holds up well .battery life wise..

I used to have a samsung galaxy tab a 8.0 with stylus..
not 
surprisingly that one the battery life didn't survive after the I think first two to three rounds of updates..

but man that thing took my trauma like hell..inspite of being smashed and flung by me...
I got a texh guy to fix the screen detachment back for me..and the touch UI kept working with the stylus only..no more with fingers 

I wish I had taken better care of that one it had the best utility for me and my wife..lol..digital signatures

ah well live and learn..

1jrvj48,"The best phone is the one that suits your usage. 

Walang best over the other kasi pag may strengths ang isang phone, may downsides na kasama. 

And sa kabilang brands, ganun din. 

In short, kailangan timbangin kung saan mas useful ang features ng phone. 

Example:

Cameras - while iphone provides consistent great camera quality sa pics and videos, marami hindi gusto ang image processing ng iphone at mas maganda din kasi ung output from other phones. 

UI - dami nagsasabi na simple at madaling gamitin ang iOS daw. Pero i don't think na ganun talaga sya. 

Daming iphone users ang mtatagal na pero nagsstruggle na maintindhan o mahanap ang certain options, settings. Why? Kasi hindi ganun kadali maintindihan ang layout ng iOS talaga. At for some reasons, hindi naka integrate sa ibang apps ang settings. Nandun sya sa settings page ng phone which doesn't make any sense and defeats the purpose of being easy to use. 

Example, camera settings. Ppunta ka pa sa settings page if may need ka iadjust or baguhin. 

App library, homescreen customization - madami nagsasabi na di naman daw need ng iphone ng customization kasi minimalist lang daw talaga ang iphone at premium tingnan.

Pero nung nirelease ung option to customize ang homescreen at control center, mga nabaliw kakacustomize. Tapos napakacomplicated ng steps to theme or setup yung homescreen customization.

Other ppl need to realize na just because it looks minimal doesn't it's easy to use and efficient. Sa sobrang minimal ng iOS, naccompromise na rin ang functionality. 

And despite the quality iphone brings, hindi sapat ung convenience na meron ang software nya in terms of UI. And that's just me. Some may or may not agree but those actually are obvious. 

Yang app optimization daw e mas maganda sa iphones. Sa totoo lang parehas may optimization sa both platforms at hindi basis ang social media apps lang pra masabi na mas optimized ang isa over the other. 

E optimized din naman ang android OS itself and some apps pag may involved na ibang devices or third-party.

Mabilis makaconnect sa ibang devices, minsan nga kahit walang apps gumagana, madaling isetup. Those are indications of good compatibility and optimization din. 

Pero kung tutuusin halos lahat ng functions within socmed apps, doable sa android apps e. Sadyang yung native in-app cameras ng socmed apps for iphone ay well-tuned when recording/taking pics and when uploading.

Personally, I use Samsung so I would recommend S25 Ultra for bar phone and Fold6 for foldable phone. Perks of Samsung would be long OS support, you can also get Samsung Care+ and better aftersales support. Especially for flagship models you are entitled for Samsung Concierge for pick up repairs and service.

If you do plan to get any Samsung device via Samsung website, I can give you a discount voucher. Just message me if you need one.

I think Poco overprocesses with sharpening, saturation, and exposure more than Samsung does to compensate for the smaller sensor. It looks ""too much"" in a sense more often with the F6 than with the A55. The selfie cam it's pretty obvious, but I have the same thoughts with the rear cameras even if the differences are not as big, and video is a bit messier with focus and stabilization on the F6. All the physical sensors are better on the A55 as well, but it's fine since that's not really the goal of the F6; it's usable as it is. Depends lang on what the user needs.

Sa green line, lahat naman ng brands may ganyan as long as they use OLED. It's getting attention from a vocal minority, which it should naman since it exists and is important, but it's realistically not common.

1js2kgm,"What phone were you on before the redmi?

Personally, I've seen alot of Redmi devices lag out, especially those below the PRO model.  
The Pro is the Baseline then Pro Plus is the better version, but for the price, might as well consider these.

Xiaomi Phones are a solid build, especially if you get the T models (14T, 13T, and other variants)  
Maybe also consider the Flagships of older years (Xiaomi 12, 13) since they are def really good still, but forgotten alot, since the the new flagship arrives.

POCO is also a great brand, price to performance wise, it's in the top picks for me, with customer service being the least. Honestly, you won't need the service if you take care of your phone. Had mine (Realme 5 pro) since 2019, and is still kicking, but used for work and reading manga. and very light gaming (girlsfrontline gacha)

Samsung A Series are fine, but it's not very price to performance great, since the A56 is a great pick, and is quite good for the model (better than A55 honestly) but consider the S24 FE (8/128) in replacement of the A56 (8/256), with the downside of storage since they are almost the same price.

I would say Oneplus, since i've heard alot of good things from them, but can't really say till i own one.

Google pixel too, since I've never gotten one to try.

1iaf3ks,"> I've been wanting to start learning photography.

Photographer here with 10+ years experience.

If you want to seriously learn photography and not just take photos casually, then you need to master the three elements of exposure in photography: aperture, shutter speed and ISO. Everything else like framing, composition and post-processing are secondary compared to learning proper exposure fundamentals.

Yes some digicams and phones have a manual or ""professional"" mode that lets you manually set shutter speed and ISO, but these options are extremely limited compared to what you can do with even a basic mirrorless camera or DSLR. This is a simple matter of physics: smaller lenses and smaller sensors are only able to physically gather smaller amounts of photons. Also, most modern phones (including iPhones and Pixels) have a tendency to over-process your images to compensate for common user mistakes (shaky hands) and hardware limitations (removing ISO noise from low-light photos). This is good for casual photography, but it's a crutch if you're trying to learn photography.

Digicams are making a comeback because there's a resurgence in interest in late 2000s-retro, but remember there's a reason why they went obsolete in the first place. People buy them because they want to get the low-res ""2000s"" aesthetic, but for general photo use they are less reliable than the average modern smartphone. You also have to remember most of them are no longer in production (no spare parts unless you find a donor unit), use old proprietary cables/batteries, are out of warranty, and have outdated software support.

On places like FB Marketplace or Carousell, you should be able to find people selling older/base model DSLRs for less than 10k. Even basic DSLRs have larger (APS-C) sensors that result in better raw photo quality, have actual apertures in the lenses, work better in low-light, have better autofocus, have optical viewfinders, better manual control, can create real depth-of-field (not just fake phone filters), and can be upgraded as your skill level also grows.",i've been wanting to start learning photography photographer here with 10 years experience if you want to seriously learn photography and not just take photos casually then you need to master the three elements of exposure in photography aperture shutter speed and iso everything else like framing composition and postprocessing are secondary compared to learning proper exposure fundamentals yes some digicams and phones have a manual or professional mode that lets you manually set shutter speed and iso but these options are extremely limited compared to what you can do with even a basic mirrorless camera or dslr this is a simple matter of physics smaller lenses and smaller sensors are only able to physically gather smaller amounts of photons also most modern phones including iphones and pixels have a tendency to overprocess your images to compensate for common user mistakes shaky hands and hardware limitations removing iso noise from lowlight photos this is good for casual photography but it's a crutch if you're trying to learn photography digicams are making a comeback because there's a resurgence in interest in late 2000sretro but remember there's a reason why they went obsolete in the first place people buy them because they want to get the lowres 2000s aesthetic but for general photo use they are less reliable than the average modern smartphone you also have to remember most of them are no longer in production no spare parts unless you find a donor unit use old proprietary cablesbatteries are out of warranty and have outdated software support on places like fb marketplace or carousell you should be able to find people selling olderbase model dslrs for less than 10k even basic dslrs have larger apsc sensors that result in better raw photo quality have actual apertures in the lenses work better in lowlight have better autofocus have optical viewfinders better manual control can create real depthoffield not just fake phone filters and can be upgraded as your skill level also grows

1iaf3ks,"For under 10k, it might be difficult to find decent mirrorless cameras like the Sony a5000/a6000 series, or the Fujifilm X-E1/XT-10 since these are good quality cameras that are still in demand even 10-12 years after their release. 

However, I've seen plenty of older DSLRs sell for around 6-9k pesos in FB or Carousell which would be around your budget. An entry-level Canon 1100D (or 1200D, 1300D, and so on) or Canon 600D (or 700D, 800D, and so on) is more than enough for learning photography and getting excellent shots. For Nikon, this would be the D3XXX series (D3100, D3200, etc.) but if you can find higher-end models (D5XXX and up) within your budget that would be better. There isn't much difference between the two big DSLR brands so just try to find the best deal that you can in your area.

Just make sure to take note of any issues if listed. Try to avoid cameras/lenses that have fungus as an issue (can be pricey to clean/repair) or those that have issues with the LCD screen.

Good luck!",for under 10k it might be difficult to find decent mirrorless cameras like the sony a5000a6000 series or the fujifilm xe1xt10 since these are good quality cameras that are still in demand even 1012 years after their release however i've seen plenty of older dslrs sell for around 69k pesos in fb or carousell which would be around your budget an entrylevel canon 1100d or 1200d 1300d and so on or canon 600d or 700d 800d and so on is more than enough for learning photography and getting excellent shots for nikon this would be the d3xxx series d3100 d3200 etc but if you can find higherend models d5xxx and up within your budget that would be better there isn't much difference between the two big dslr brands so just try to find the best deal that you can in your area just make sure to take note of any issues if listed try to avoid cameraslenses that have fungus as an issue can be pricey to cleanrepair or those that have issues with the lcd screen meetups so you can test the camera is always preferable and make sure to take sample shots first before buying this checklist can help you to learn what to look for when buying used cameraslenses good luck

1glp6tp,"Don't fall for the MLM products sa comsec, too overpriced and unnecessary budol lang talaga in my opinion. Here's what I can suggest: 

1. Iron - lalo na kung anemic ka. 
2. Vitamin C - some take Berocca, some take the Vitamin C by itself. Depende na lang kung anong brand iinumin mo. There are different types of Vitamin C, mind you so do your research on that. Be careful sa ascorbic acid if acidic ka. I do take the latter though, Rhea brand.
3. Vitamin D - important to because this vitamin helps your body produce melatonin, which is responsible for regulating your sleep. Strategic dapat ang pag-inom nito, 6-8 hours before ka matutulog because your body won't produce melatonin agad-agad. Similarly, kung night naman matutulog, during the day ang inom nito. 
4. Vitamin E - your skin will thank you for it, trust me. Myra-E pwede na.
5. Magnesium Glycinate - nakakabawas ng anxiety (at least for me), and nakakatulong talaga to sa pagtulog. May iba't-ibang klase ng magnesium supplements so research on those as well. 
6. Vitamin B Complex - helps with proper brain function and energy. May Rhea nito.
7. Zinc - helps with stregthening immune system and metabolism function din. Zinbee gamit ko dito. 

Those are the basics vitamins, afaik. Other things like Omega 3 (for heart and brain health), Probiotic (gut health), collagen (skin elasticity), folate (good for women especially if peak reproductive stage), will be great add-ons to your daily supplements but not necessarily needed since the vitamins above can cover these for now. Also, ayusin ang mga kinakain. Walang kwenta ang vitamins and supplements kung nilalason mo pa rin katawan mo sa mga kinakain mo.

1glp6tp,"Here's how I usually take it (I'm a morning person, usually): 

Morning, 7-9AM:  Iron, Vitamin C (30 mins before eating)

Before lunch, 11-12AM: Vitamin B (di pwede isabay with other supplements since di maaabsorb ng katawan) 

Lunch time, 12PM- 1PM: Vitamin D (after eating, don't take these on an empty stomach), pwede rin dito Vitamin C (1 hour after eating)

Before or during dinnertime, 6-7PM: Zinc 

1 hour before sleeping: Magnesium (eat something before you drink this tho), Vitamin E 


Note: kung may pre-existing medical conditions ka, best to consult with licensed medical practitioner first. Ako tumigil sa Iron kasi nagkaka-digestion issues, but it doesn't mean it won't work for you. 

Additional notes: 

** Best pagsabayin Iron & Vitamin C since maabsorb ng katawan ang Iron ng maayos. If humihilab tiyan mo pag uminom nito, try taking them with a light meal first. Wag mo lang sila isabay sa coffee and tea tho, lalo kang maaacid. 

** Take zinc alone. Pwede i-take ng walang laman ang tiyan, pero kung hindi okay sa tiyan mo, after meal na lang.

For that budget, I'd recommend getting the **A35 5G** or a used **Pixel 7/7a**. There is no iPhone that can offer you good value at 15k. iPhone 11 is prehistoric and the battery is awful.

Still, Pixel 7/7a's shots will look more natural and *better* than A35 5G. Samsung has better selfies though.

But having more RAM (referencing to 16 GB) is also helpful when youre handling the data. Hence why 32 GB RAM is actually not a bad idea but 16 GB is a fine starting point. I've seen data analyst friends crunch data consuming 20-25 GB RAM.

Both are an ideal choice if you‚Äôre looking for a portable fan with both power and versatility. But the Jisulife Pro1S offers a more significant cooling performance. The Pro 1S also has 100 adjustable levels, allowing you to precisely control the airflow intensity, unlike the Life 9, which only provides five speed settings. This high-speed capability makes the Pro1S more effective for use in hot outdoor conditions, where you might need stronger cooling. 

The Jisulife Pro1S is also built with a premium metal exterior, it boasts a sleekeker and more durable design that feels more robust than the lighter, more casual Life 9 model.

2) **Wireless over WiFi network** - the device and your phone connect to the same WiFi network and use that to transmit data between them and connect to the internet separately. For example, a Chromecast or an Android TV stick/ box. You can mirror your screen and instruct it to retrieve content from the internet without opening it on your phone.

3) **Wireless over WiFi Direct** - also known as Miracast. The device establishes a WiFi Direct connection to your phone. Think of it as a mini WiFi network that's just between the two devices, much like how a hotspot would operate. However unlike a hotspot it's only limited to screen sharing, as the device can't connect to the internet on its own, and you will need to have the content playing on your phone the whole time. It's fine for sharing videos played locally on your phone, free online content like YouTube, sharing your browser or a powerpoint, but you can't use this for apps with digital rights protection, like Netflix.

What you probably saw is a Miracast device pretending to be a Chromecast. Miracast devices typically go for around 300+ pesos. It might still work for screen sharing but it will have limitations. I generally avoid products that pretend to be something else. Did a quick search on Shopee and [this one](https://ph.shp.ee/htmFiso) looks like a good, basic Miracast alternative.",1 wired  if your phone supports video out all you will need is a usb c to hdmi cable 2 wireless over wifi network  the device and your phone connect to the same wifi network and use that to transmit data between them and connect to the internet separately for example a chromecast or an android tv stick box you can mirror your screen and instruct it to retrieve content from the internet without opening it on your phone 3 wireless over wifi direct  also known as miracast the device establishes a wifi direct connection to your phone think of it as a mini wifi network that's just between the two devices much like how a hotspot would operate however unlike a hotspot it's only limited to screen sharing as the device can't connect to the internet on its own and you will need to have the content playing on your phone the whole time it's fine for sharing videos played locally on your phone free online content like youtube sharing your browser or a powerpoint but you can't use this for apps with digital rights protection like netflix what you probably saw is a miracast device pretending to be a chromecast miracast devices typically go for around 300 pesos it might still work for screen sharing but it will have limitations i generally avoid products that pretend to be something else did a quick search on shopee and this one looks like a good basic miracast alternative

Pero baka ma-disappoint lang ako kasi lahat ng gadgets ko, android and windows (acer laptop 2017-ish, samsung phone, and xiaomi pad 6) and baka hindi seamless yung transferring files. Plus, I came from a 12gb ram laptop kasi. At kung kukunin ko ang M1 8gb ram, feeling ko makukulangan ako. So I need 12gb ram or 16gb ram onwards. And I believe yung mga 16gb ram lappys sa apple ay 60k+ which is out of budget range, kahit na sabihing i-home credit namin. Baka sobrang mahal ng dp, eh 10k lang kaya i-dp namin tas less than 2.5k na monthly lang sana. Tsaka the reason why I opt for windows lappys most of the time ay dahil upgradeable sila and the upgrades are cheaper than buying a newer laptop. Though, I am very aware na 'yung Lenovo lappy sa option ko ay naka soldered na, at least 16gb ram siya tas less than 45k. Whereas yung Asus lappy naman ay pwede sooner or later, i-upgrade ko yung ram to 16gb.

Regarding file transfer naman with apple, if you need to transfer files from your phone/windows, you can do it with an external SSD (super fast transfer, that's what I do)

1j7zqu8,"ThinkPads have gone down in Quality in the recent years but I see it still being heavily recommended for robustness.

I like to point out an example of build quality issue with the choice of connecting Hinges onto screw mounts embedded onto plastics.  

Repeated opening and closing from the side leads to the plastic cracking early and the hinge failing especially on the heavier lids laptops in the 15 to 18 inch category. But to be fair this is a common issue even among other larger models.

This problem doesn't exist in MacBooks though. If you study a disassembled MacBook you will notice  that the Hinges are connected to a screw hole machined into the aluminum chassis. 

Most Windows Laptop either have these screw holes embedded within plastic like the ThinkPads or bonded with epoxy on models with aluminum chassis to save on manufacturing cost. 

This why I like MacBook so much, they don't skimp on quality both inside and outside. 

MacBooks are expensive to repair because of this as well. With ThinkPad it's cheaper because it's  just a matter of gluing another plastic part replacement on the hinge. 

So think about it. Do you want a repairable laptop that have parts that fail on daily use? Or a laptop that's expensive to repair but takes an accident to damage?",thinkpads have gone down in quality in the recent years but i see it still being heavily recommended for robustness i like to point out an example of build quality issue with the choice of connecting hinges onto screw mounts embedded onto plastics repeated opening and closing from the side leads to the plastic cracking early and the hinge failing especially on the heavier lids laptops in the 15 to 18 inch category but to be fair this is a common issue even among other larger models this problem doesn't exist in macbooks though if you study a disassembled macbook you will notice that the hinges are connected to a screw hole machined into the aluminum chassis most windows laptop either have these screw holes embedded within plastic like the thinkpads or bonded with epoxy on models with aluminum chassis to save on manufacturing cost this why i like macbook so much they don't skimp on quality both inside and outside macbooks are expensive to repair because of this as well with thinkpad it's cheaper because it's just a matter of gluing another plastic part replacement on the hinge so think about it do you want a repairable laptop that have parts that fail on daily use or a laptop that's expensive to repair but takes an accident to damage

It decreases at least 10/15 percent for 4 hours and that's with auto sync turned off btw.

Incorrect, lahat ng devices na may battery ay may battery health na dapat imaintain. Sadyang ginawang visible lang ng Apple ang battery health so users will be able to see if it‚Äôs time to replace the battery, whereas sa android devices, ikaw pa mismo makikiramdam if the battery has degraded significantly.

This applies to other products as well that are registered with the FDA. Not only does your manufacturer have to be compliant with the US FDA but your product must also meet US FDA standards.

Every few months, Amazon Global conducts a caravan-seminar here in Manila for Filipinos who want to sell on Amazon. It might be worth checking out for you since they have recommended vendors (shipment, storefront management, banking, etc) so think of it as a one-stop shop. 

It is definitely doable but you need a good team for your marketing since keywords din ang labanan sa Amazon. I have an agency partner which I can forward to you if you like.
