I used to have a shop on Shopee, but I had to close it when they started requiring taxes and proper business registration under DTI. After weighing my options, I felt like it wasn‚Äôt worth going through all that hassle, so I just decided to close it.

The first time I tried booking through the jnt app, my pick-up request was denied (aka, walang pumunta the whole day) because I wasn‚Äôt a ""VIP seller."" It‚Äôs so frustrating, bakit pa nila ino-offer sa app yung option for pick-up if hindi naman kukunin? Wtf.

Then, when I dropped off na yung parcel (yes naglakad ako for like half an hour, lol), they charged me an extra 10 PHP for some reason, even though I had already packed the item properly. The product was wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap, placed inside a box, and sealed in a pouch. Then yung ginawa ni JNT person is nilagyan ulit ng bubble wrap, tapos dinikit yung waybill sa taas. Medyo madumi tignan, tbh. :))

Can anyone recommend a good courier company? Or can anyone help me? At this point feel ko po wala na talagang mangyayari, bruh. Their service has been terrible for the longest time.

- Entertainment (reading manhwa/manga and watching)

- Samsung Galaxy A9+ (the 8gb one since it's currently on sale I believe) 
- Redmi Pad SE 

I just don't know if these are worth it.

- Durability (ung fan na kahit nabagsak, gora pa din)

- Battery life 

- Airflow / Performance 

- Noise level (sana hindi parang jet engine)

- Value for money (di naman kailangan sobrang mahal, basta sulit)

I tried buying some nibs on shopee but the quality was kinda bad, but I think it was to be expected naman for the price. The ones I bought from shopee wears down really fast esp dahil paperlike ang screen protector, but it was only 12 php each so I didn't really mind. However, one of the nibs got decapitated while it was still inside the pen, buti hindi naputol fully ung head nung nib kaya I was able to pull the nib's whole body out of the pen. But this got me worried, kasi baka maulit ulit and it's going to be a real problem kapag totally naputol ung head and body ng nib.

Noon, I bought a replacement nib from Samsung mismo, but afaik walang binebentang nibs sa regular stores , dapat mismo sa service center ka bibili, eh ang hassle sobra. I remember it was 200 php for a single nib, which I find to be crazy expensive. Tapos nung time na un hindi ko pa makuha agad kasi walang stock, I had to reserve and waited for 1-2 weeks iirc just to get a nib, it was so much hassle, ayaw ko nang ulitin ulit. Altho if anyone knows a reseller store that sells the official s-pen nibs, please tell me, ok lang kahit nasa 200 rin basta hindi napuputol ng ganon ung ulo ü•≤.

Yung malamig sana tela or at least hindi nakakapawis kasi hindi naman ako naka aircon, kuntento naman ako sa bintana + efan kaso pag medyo mainit di maiwasan mapawisan pag pangit yung tela. Di ko alam kung ano yung specific na tela na hinahanap ko HAHAHA.

Wala rin akong specific na design na hinahanap basta hindi lang hello kitty o cars o winnie the pooh HAHAHA.

Ayun lamang, wala naman budget restriction basta reasonable lang yung price.

Pa send na lang po ng link.

Long time Android user po ako (currently using a Samsung S23), and thinking of getting an iPhone 13 mini as a dumbphone/work phone. 

Nung una, parang hindi ko keri or I don't see the need na mag 2 smartphones pero ngayon kasi naloloka na po ako kapag nakaka-kita ng work-related notifs sa personal phone ko. Plus, nai-intrigue din po kasi ako sa iPhone and curious as to why maraming obsessed dito besides being a status symbol? Is it really gonna boost productivity?

Here's my set of questions po:

1) Currently using an Asus as my work laptop and all of your systems sa work run on Windows (M365, Sharepoint, Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) hindi po ba talaga si-sync smoothly sa current work apps ang isang iPhone? Pero mainly just gonna use the phone for WhatsApp, Outlook and calls using our softphone na meron din sa app store, will it be feasible or usable po ba?

2) Taga-probinsya po ako planning po lumuwas pa-Maynila at bumili sa Greenhills. Safe and legit po ba bumili ng iPhones po doon? Ano pong tips ang maari nyong i-share na safe practices when buying po ng iPhone sa Greenhills para iwas scam and to check the legitimacy? And sa tingin nyo po for the purpose na na-mention po ano pong mas maganda, brand new sealed or 2nd-hand po.

It has a thick creamy texture and bleaches my towel as well. But when I checked the app again, it's suddenly unavailable in PH na :(((( and since I only bought a small one I know it won't last long. Ayoko naman tipirin kaya gusto ko makahanap ng another legit store agad. 

I bought my first PanOxyl Peroxide from skincarebudmnl last 2 mos but it had a watery texture kahit di pinipiga kusang lumalabas. Based on what I've researched, the original one should have a thick texture like the one from iHerb. But lumala yung skin ko sa unang try ko pa lang ng from skincarebudmnl, just tried using it thrice but nung wala talagang good effects/it got worse, I stopped using it. 

Then I read about this store here on reddit after buying one from it, how they both sell real and fake ones (swertihan na lang kung ano ma-receive mo) and seems like that ºs really the case since there are a bunch of positive reviews about it, the reason I was convinced to buy in the first place.

Tho wala naman issue sa price basta alam kong worth it, pero ayoko na mag-take ng risk sa 1k+ ang prices pero fake pala. Pls suggest legit online stores, thank you so much!!! 

Orig PanOxyl Peroxide:
- Amoy chlorine
- Bleaches towel (yung towel kong gray nagka-pink na siya) 
- Thick texture (parang malambot na toothpaste)

Stores I'm considering but still not sure if legit:
- Flagship store sa L app
- BeautyPort Mall

+ I'm also new here, so I hope I'm not violating any rules.

1jlog45,"Why the f%ck are people defending Shopee in their ""0% interest for 3 months but with %5 admin fee"" SPayLater fiasco?!?",why the fck are people defending shopee in their 0 interest for 3 months but with 5 admin fee spaylater fiasco,"So currently, it has been trending in social media that the ShopeePayLater that is ""0% interest for 3 months"" is not really zero percent because of an added %5 admin fee.

Defenders has been saying that it is declared in the ""fine print"". But seriously, as a credit card user that uses my credit card for majority of my purchases, whenever stores say ""0% interest for 3 months via credit card"", it is simply dividing by 3 the actual amount. For example, if the price tag of the item is Php 30,000 and it says ""0% interest for 3 months via credit card"", if I availed it using my credit card, I will only need to pay Php 10,000 monthly for 3 months and that's it.

To illustrate the SPayLater admin fee add-on further. Let's say the admin fee is 50% instead of just 5%. The 50% admin fee for Php 30,000 is Php 15,000. So with SPayLater of ""0% interest for 3 months"" ^(but with 50% admin fee), it will be Php 15,000 monthly for 3 months making of a grand total of Php 45,000 with the admin fee.

**To declare something as 0% interest for 3 months but there's an add-on fee like ""admin fee"", etc. is not really zero percent.** Iniba lang yung tawag sa supposed na interest.

I hope somebody will file a formal complaint against Shopee with DTI because this is very **misleading**. The fine print is not seen in the checkout page (you have to specifically search for it). There are no disclaimers in the checkout page saying there is some additional admin fee. And not everybody is good in month. Also, add the fact that in the past, there are no admin fees in ""0% interest for x months"" with SPayLater. I'm sure maraming hindi aware sa bagong ""admin fee"" na eto na wala naman noon.

Most of the ones I see in malls are made of wood (and too pricey for me), but I‚Äôd prefer something iron or metal. A lot of results come up on Shopee when I search, but I‚Äôm a bit worried about the quality. 

Has anyone here tried buying a metal bed frame from Shopee? Are they actually okay/sturdy in real life?

1jjqm76,LAZADA : Always check Shop's homepage to collect vouchers.,lazada  always check shop's homepage to collect vouchers," I have collected vouchers from all over the app (voucher channel, shop homepage, product page etc.). Basta hindi grayed out yung Collect and I think I can use it, I collect the voucher.  It came to a point pa nga na na-reach ko yung max number of vouchers na pwede i-collect that I had to discard some of them.  Fortunately, wala na yatang limit ngayon.

 It was only recently (ngayong birthday sale) that I've learned na the product page doesn't always include all vouchers applicable to the item.  If I remember it right, nung hindi pa dropdown style yung vouchers sa product page, nandun lahat ng voucher (from Free Shipping to App-wide to Store-wide to Item-specific) na pwede gamitin sa item.  Ngayon di ko na sure kung ganun pren. Kase yung ibang vouchers kahit na-collect ko na from the product page, di ko sya nagagamit even if nameet naman yung min. spend requirement.  

 I've had the airpods pro 2 sa cart ko since last year and nagbrowse ako nitong sale and ang pinakamurang nakita ko is 10,690 to 10,790 (that's with the less 1.2k Lazada voucher).  Pumunta ako dun sa voucher portion sa product page nung isa sa nakita ko to see kung magkano yung max coins na pwede ko magamit (Thanks reddit for the tip.  I have 20k coins.).  1% or 119.90 lang yung max and yung sa Whitehaus lang yung pwedeng gamitan ng coins.  I was about to checkout na kase yun na yung range ng price na lagi ko nakikita since last year pa kapag sale (though may nakita ako dito sa reddit na 3k nya nabili during a random flash sale sa shopee), when I decided to go to the shop homepage at baka may voucher pa in case I follow the store. Eh naka-follow na pala ako since nakabili na ako sa kanila ng airtag before.  Tapos nakita ko na may mga vouchers na pwede iclaim. Inisa-isa ko pa yung mga vouchers since all of them were applicable to a specific item only like for an Apple pencil, for an Apple watch etc.  Tapos nakita ko yung isa 3k and it's for the airpods pro though sa lightning version nga lang sya applicable.  Ok pren nman for me since I still use lightning for my phone. Medyo nag-alangan pa nga ako kase may option na NEW and OPEN SEALED.  Dinouble-check ko pa kase baka yung open sealed yung may discount pero yung sa lightning+NEW lang talaga sya applicable.  I've gone back sa voucher portion ng product page and wala talaga dun yung 3k voucher even yung ibang item-specific vouchers, wala rin sa produxt page nung item na pwedeng paggamitan nung mga vouchers na yun. Nagtry ako na isearch uli yung product and yung 10,790 (naka-indicate na voucher applied price nya yun) talaga yung lumalabas. Sa coins page, 10,670.10 yung price nya. Sa Lucky Egg, ganun din. Dun lang sa product page and cart ko lumalabas yung less 3k na price.  Medyo naghintay pa ako ng ilang oras kase baka glitch lang pala yun plus gusto ko sana yung 1.5k less na 11 PM daily flash voucher (I know abuso naman masyado. Hehe.) kaso naunahan ako sa pag-claim.  Tapos never naman bumaba yung stock nya unlike yung usb-c version.  11:50PM ko na sya chineckout para in case magmura pa sya after midnight, (Baka maging 3k na lang. Hehe.) madali ko lang macancel and mareorder.  I forgot to mention na til 03/24 23:59 lang yung voucher kaya nagcheckout nren ako.  Pagpatak ng midnight, binalikan ko yung homepage, wala nang ganung voucher (baka rin kase na-claim ko na yung saken. Tingnan nyo sa inyo, baka meron.)  Ngayon, I'm just hoping na i-ship sya ng seller and hindi masalisihan ng courier.

 So, moral of the story, ALWAYS COLLECT THEM VOUCHERS. Basta hindi grayed out yung Collect, claim mo lang yung voucher and kung may time ka, browse mo lahat ng pwedeng puntahan sa app.  I know magulo ang UI nya ( Though personally, mas gusto ko sya kesa sa shopee.) pero worth it naman pag naka-save ka nang malaki because of your discoveries. Promise enjoy din naman. Hehe.

I would just like to ask what to do in our situation right now. We received a heavy-duty folding table. We opened the parcel the next day (not 24 hours after the delivery) and took full video unless the table had dents or damages, which unfortunately, it had. We noticed there was no fragile sticked placed on the bubble wrap.

It was a mistake from my part to click the ""order received"" option since I tried to check if the merchandise protection I specifically added during the transaction would help secure the damages incurred to our product. However, I saw here on reddit na mali raw yung tini-tick yun before applying for retun/refund. Now, naka request naman na kami ng return/refund pero I fear na baka si seller hindi ibabalik yung money na nabayad po namin once na mabalik na namin yung product.

Help po sana kung anong gagawin. Na message na rin po namin yung seller and they said they would compensate me 50 pesos ""kung okay lang po sa inyo"". I was astounded to even reply.

Limited stocks only and I actually bought mine 2 days ago tapos nag iba price yesterday then ngayon bumalik ulit. Upon checking right now, 5 stocks nalang yung nakalagay as of posting and I'm not quite sure if all stocks will be on 50% off.

  
My thoughts about it:

* No unnecessary smell/taste from the flask. 
* Can keep my water cold for a long time though I haven't tried to test the claim na 24 hours yung stay ng coldness kasi nauubos ko na yung nilagay kong water before pa mag 24 hours.
* Sakto lang yung laki for going out so it's easy to bring anywhere. 21oz pala sya or 621mL.
*  Bought this so I can drink cold water na hindi pabalik balik lalo na ang taas ng heat index ngayon and so far I'm satisfied with it.
* Super +++ yung lifetime warranty included. Heard about claims na mabilis daw makipag exchange kay Hydroflask (for manufacturer defects only) and dadalhin mo lang sa store, though case to case basis parin but it's a good feature for me lalo na ang expensive nya.
* To be honest, it's a bit expensive for a flask since there's a lot of cheaper alternative available in the market. Though the 50% discount made me buy it since ang laking bawas nya for hydroflask and same price narin with the alternatives.

*Tips for WiFi 6 Routers always look for the specs it should have at least the 160hz channel to take advantage or for full boost speed wifi6, (wag papasilaw sa wifi 6 logo or naming tapus kapos pala sa specs, sayang lang pera, pls. be wise and do research)

*Tips for WiFi 7 Routers always look for triple band(with 6ghz band), MLO(for wifi7 devices and above) and a 320hz channel, pag wala skip mo na if you are seriously looking for a full pledge wifi7

1juwtb4,dito home wifi over pldt fibr connection w landline,dito home wifi over pldt fibr connection w landline,"
ik depende to sa location pero assuming ok ang signal ng Dito and Globe and Smart 5g sims samin on a normal day, yung walang ulan, in general, is is it a smart move to cut my pldt wired line for a sim wifi? 5g devices. am i making a mistake by cutting a wired line just to save?

context:

after paying for pldt 2399 plan for 3 years, i realized that its a lot to pay for internet that isnt that fast in the first place (like pag may 2 taong naka-zoom/teams call, choppy na for 2nd). the plan is used by 2 floors w the mesh. for surfing and youtube ok naman sya pero ig dahil 2 floors pag nasa kwarto mej 480p na lang ako ganun pag lahat kami naka connect haha

now, i bought a Dito home wifi kasi naka-sale sa shopee, and after testing for 2 days palang, malakas naman sya, abot sa kwarto and ok for 5 devices atleast. id still have to see pano pag may work laptop na kasi may isa saming naka wfh pero aside from that im leaning on cutting my pldt line altogether. 

kasi tinignan ko magkano load, and lumlabas halos 600-650 lang babayran ko sa Dito load, and then if bibili ako isa pang wifi (pwdeng globe or smart device naman) para sa 1st flr naman edi 1200-1300 lang yun vs 2500 ko sa pldt rn. 

is this a smart move? do you think malaking problem yun if maulan kunwari and sim lang yung wifi ko instead of yung wired line like pldt? im planning to get smart or globe prepaid sa baba para in case walang signal si dito may iba pa ko sim.

for the landline, i do use it pero i dont think worth it yung babayaran ko sya every month na minsan kk lang gagamitin haha pwd naman mag load na lang or if may toll free better.


any insights?

1. Proceed with the return/refund.

I‚Äôd prefer option 2 since it‚Äôs more convenient and I wouldn‚Äôt need to drop the item off at Shopee Express or J&T. However, I‚Äôm unsure how reliable this option is.

Nagka-problema yung fan ko (Pro 1s) kanina while nasa face to face class ako, biglang ayaw na mag-on at di na nagcha-charge, kahit wala naman akong ginawa or even nabagsak. So I messaged them on Shopee, and grabe ang bilis ng customer service nila!

As in, it only took like 30 minutes to fully resolve my concern. I bought my fan last September 2024, so pasok pa rin siya sa 1-year warranty. Instead of asking me to return or repair the item, binigyan agad ako ng full voucher para makabili ulit ng same product for free (shipping lang sagot ko, which is okay lang naman). Sobrang hassle-free and smooth ng process.

So ayun, if ever bibili kayo ng fan or anything from JISULIFE, go for their official store sa Shopee.

Pero baka palitan ko ng iba kasi pang student lang yung hangin at more on lakad siya pag andito sa Pinas saka pawisin siyang tao.

while I saw that poco x7 pro is a big upgrade, it can only be bought it at 15k max w/ vouchers etc, so its a no no for now

1ji0m0r,Grass cutter review,grass cutter review,"For the farmers na naghahanap ng grass cutter.

Pros:
-really cheap
-works

Cons:
-build quality is also noticably cheap
-shuts down after 2 hours of constant use
-front guard doesnt have a notch slot kaya lagi siya nagagalaw
-strap is really basic, needs a padding sa shoulder
-left handle is not secured by a screw or bolt. It keeps sliding off
-blade and blade attachments(nylon) are really shit
-unexpected shutdown happen because of loose carburetor. I suspect because of all the vibration.

RATING: 4/5

Why 4 despite of all the bad things? Because an original honda grass cutter costs minimum 16k. Even branded low end chinese clones(ingco, powerhouse, lotus) costs 6k-9k. This sketchy clone only costs me 2.7k(+500 for strap and blade replacement) and it just works! Already bought my second one so i can just swap grass cutters for continous use.

Tips when buying:
-ipon ng coins by doing the coins daillies and lazada games. You have to do the coin trick. Google ""reddit lazada coin guide"". First result should be a reddit post with a video and written instructions.
-dun sa product variation pick the cheapest non 2-stroke option. It will only have the default blade. Thats okay because you need to buy a good blade. 
-do this sa mga sulit sweldo, 15th or 30th of the month. Cheapest ko na nakita ko is 1.9k with coins and voucher. I forgot to checkout that day.

When you have the product:
-buy grease(200 a tub)
-buy sae 10w30 engine oil(200-400 a L)
-i recommend dalhin mo to sa local motorcycle/auto mechanic. Nahirapan ako solo and dinala ko sa mechanic para iassemble. I paid 200. Pinanuod ko sila and confindently ko na naassemble 2nd grass cutter ko.

Maintenance:
-during the first week sa akin i just left the engine runing idle at least 30mins before actual use para masanay engine.
-empty the gas compartment after usage. Wag magiwan ng gas kasi may nasisira siyan internal component pag matagal maiwan. Mas mura ang gas kaysa sa new grass cutter or replacement part. Pwede mo ipump out yung remaining gas sa loob by removing on of the tubes and pressing the pump. Ask the mechanic to show you.
-spark plugs and carburetor yung unang nasisira lagi. Stock up para pag masira pwede mo na ibigay agad sa mechanic yung part.
-ask mechanic for maintenance tips

More recommendations:
-buy a protective earmuff. Mga 250 lang yun. Protect your ears
-buy mechanic gloves. May tig 300. Helps sa vibration
-buy a face shield with a notch sa band para pwede mo lagay faceshield sa taas ng earmuffs. May tig 300 ako na binili pero sa china galing kaya tagal dumating

Tnx for reading my wall of words.

1jkdx00,Romand's Juicy Lasting Tint - My Experience,romand's juicy lasting tint  my experience,"Hello everyone! it's been 3 months since I bought¬†Romand's juicy lasting tint¬†and since it's getting popular recently, I thought I'd make a review with my experience!

https://preview.redd.it/hei4c0e2u1re1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ac2f2cc43266f1836a3d23478077cde869e4679

**Shade Range & Pigmentation**: Romand definitely has lots of shades. I picked¬†*Bare Grape*, one of their neutral tones, since I wanted to play it a little safe since this was my first product from them. I personally like the color. It gives mlbb shade and I thought it would be perfect for a clean girl look. As for its pigmentation, since it's glossy, I would recommend putting a lot of layers if you really want it to stand out since it's very thin, but one layer will do just fine for everyday wear.

**Formula & Texture**: The tint has a glossy finish. I have dry lips, but it doesn't settle in my inner lips like most lip tints, and it feels very lightweight. However, it does feel sticky upon applying it, but the feeling fades overtime.

https://preview.redd.it/mam0ep64u1re1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbbae12b8a62cb2bf150e7bc65f60b7d16efaeac

**Longevity & Wear Test:**¬†The product claims to be a long lasting tint, but it does not last in my experience. The gloss fades quickly and the tint it leaves was really subtle. The longest it lasted on my lips while being noticeable was about an hour without eating or drinking.

**Scent & Taste:**¬†Upon observation, their juicy lasting tint series are named after fruits. The scent of bare grape definitely had a fruity candy scent that is not too strong but evident. As for its taste, there is none noticeable.

**Price & Value:**¬†I somehow got it slightly a bit cheaper than usual since it's priced around 349 pesos originally if not on sale. It contains 5.5g. I use it religiously every day for about 3 months now and I still have lots of it, so I'd say it's a pretty good purchase.

**Final Verdict:**¬†I'd rate Romand's juicy lasting tint a 7/10. I'd definitely recommend this tint. It looked very pretty on my lips; I just wish its tint lasted a bit longer! I would repurchase it too, but maybe in a different shade.

1jzi4mw,Nintendo Switch Scam?,nintendo switch scam,"Posting for awareness. Be careful when buying in Lazada. So while I was browsing for Nintendo Switch prices for todays Payday Sale, I clicked a LazMall Listing that has a 13k php price then when i clicked add to cart I saw a Zelda Version being sold at only 8500 php. I cannot find the store name in the product page but there was a chat option. Since i was skeptical of the price, I inquired if the Zelda option only includes the joycon/stick and they said it is complete. I clicked the name of the store in chat and it directed me to its official store. 

When I got to the products page, I can't find the supposed product. I can only access it by using the search function outside the store page.

I also observed that when the White Oled is selected(around 35 seconds in the video), the product is LazMall but if I select the Zelda Version, the LazMall is gone. Then around 40 seconds in the video, I selected the Zelda Version and clicked the Chat again. The chat connected to a store/user 'AhxkaYe'.

That's when I became 100% sure that the product is a sham. I felt that it is too good to be true for its pricing and I am glad that my money is safe too.

1josm6c,Tried to cancel so I can reorder the same thing but CS kept stalling until they couldn't cancel anymore,tried to cancel so i can reorder the same thing but cs kept stalling until they couldn't cancel anymore,"On the day of the Poco F7 Ultra livestream, I placed an order immediately after the announcement, which advertised an early bird promotion. The product listing made it seem like a free 50W wireless charger was included. However, after ordering, I found out the charger had to be manually added through a separate ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù listing‚Äîsomething not clearly stated in the description.

Since my order was still processing, I contacted Poco CS (Cucumber) to cancel it so I could reorder correctly. Poco CS claimed they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt support cancellations‚Äù and that only Lazada could do it. But when I contacted Lazada CS, they confirmed that cancellations are the store‚Äôs responsibility.

When I relayed this back, Poco CS refused to take action, giving scripted, vague responses and repeatedly telling me to ‚Äúwait for Lazada to process it.‚Äù Despite my request, my order was still handed to logistics 24 hours later, even though their own policy allows cancellations before shipment.

At that point, Poco CS told me to just reject the package upon delivery‚Äîa dismissive response that would mean losing the early bird discount due to refund delays. When I asked again if they were 100% sure they didn't include the charger, I was condescendingly told, ‚Äúbetter luck next time.‚Äù

Seeing as it is against DTI practice to sell something with a promised freebie but fail to provide it, this could be considered a deceptive sales practice and a violation of consumer protection laws which led me to ask if they could just ship the charger separately, but my messages were ignored. Two days later, they finally responded, saying the freebie was out of stock‚Äîsomething they could have told me earlier instead of stalling until it was too late.

After speaking with Lazada CS, I found out that some Chinese stores deliberately stall cancellations to protect their store ratings, which is exactly what seems to have happened here.

TL;DR:

I tried to cancel my order before it was shipped so I could reorder with the freebie while the early bird promo was still active. Poco CS ignored my request, stalled, and shipped it anyway‚Äîthen condescendingly told me ""better luck next time"" when I asked about the missing freebie. No resolution, assistance or compensation was provided whatsoever

I still want the phone, so I won‚Äôt reject the package, but this entire situation was deliberately mishandled. Instead of being upfront, Poco CS wasted my time, stalled my cancellation, and only admitted the freebie was out of stock once it was too late to fix.

This wasn‚Äôt just poor service‚Äîit felt like it was deliberate and deceptive

Thoughts? Am I overreacting here, or is this a valid concern?

I'm open to discussion because if sellers can deliberately stall cancellations the moment they're requested, that raises serious questions about Lazada's consumer protection policies.",on the day of the poco f7 ultra livestream i placed an order immediately after the announcement which advertised an early bird promotion the product listing made it seem like a free 50w wireless charger was included however after ordering i found out the charger had to be manually added through a separate not for sale listingsomething not clearly stated in the description since my order was still processing i contacted poco cs cucumber to cancel it so i could reorder correctly poco cs claimed they dont support cancellations and that only lazada could do it but when i contacted lazada cs they confirmed that cancellations are the stores responsibility when i relayed this back poco cs refused to take action giving scripted vague responses and repeatedly telling me to wait for lazada to process it despite my request my order was still handed to logistics 24 hours later even though their own policy allows cancellations before shipment at that point poco cs told me to just reject the package upon deliverya dismissive response that would mean losing the early bird discount due to refund delays when i asked again if they were 100 sure they didn't include the charger i was condescendingly told better luck next time seeing as it is against dti practice to sell something with a promised freebie but fail to provide it this could be considered a deceptive sales practice and a violation of consumer protection laws which led me to ask if they could just ship the charger separately but my messages were ignored two days later they finally responded saying the freebie was out of stocksomething they could have told me earlier instead of stalling until it was too late after speaking with lazada cs i found out that some chinese stores deliberately stall cancellations to protect their store ratings which is exactly what seems to have happened here tldr i tried to cancel my order before it was shipped so i could reorder with the freebie while the early bird promo was still active poco cs ignored my request stalled and shipped it anywaythen condescendingly told me better luck next time when i asked about the missing freebie no resolution assistance or compensation was provided whatsoever i still want the phone so i wont reject the package but this entire situation was deliberately mishandled instead of being upfront poco cs wasted my time stalled my cancellation and only admitted the freebie was out of stock once it was too late to fix this wasnt just poor serviceit felt like it was deliberate and deceptive thoughts am i overreacting here or is this a valid concern i'm open to discussion because if sellers can deliberately stall cancellations the moment they're requested that raises serious questions about lazada's consumer protection policies,7

Sobrang gulong gulo yung isip ko pero syempre dahil may sarili akong pamilya na kailangan kong buhayin, mabilis kong pinrocess yung nangyari at nag move on na agad. Now, naghahanap ako ng pwedeng ma-applyan. Eto kasing work ko na to is referred lang din ng isang kaibigan.

Nagshift ako ng career from an engineer sa manufacturing industry to a product lister. Unfortunately, upon further checking sa mga job posts, mostly ang hinahanap is may exp sa platforms like Shopify, Amazon, Ebay and etc. Ang problema e yung platform na gamit namin hindi kilala although some people say na sila daw ang US version ng Tiktok Shop.
